## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
State <- c("State 1", "State 2", "State 3")
distance <- c("40m", "1300m", "57km")
distance.CI <- c("39-41m", "128-138km", "55-60km")
angle <- c("177°", "166°", "0.8°")
angle.CI <- c("173-180°", "140-192°", "-1.8-3.4°")
beh <- c("chick brooding, foraging", "local flights", "migratory")
des <- c("circuitous/short", "local/semidirected", "distant/straight")
Table <- data.frame(cbind(distance, distance.CI, angle, angle.CI, beh, des))
colnames(Table)<-c("Distance", "Distance 95% CI", "Angle", "Angle 95% CI", "Behavior", "Description")
Tab <- rbind(State, t(Table))
rownames(Tab)[1] <- c("")
kable(Tab) %>%
  kable_styling(html_font = "Georgia", bootstrap_options = "striped")%>%
  column_spec(1, bold = F, background = "#d7f7d2")%>%
  row_spec(1, bold = T, background = "#eaeaea")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
